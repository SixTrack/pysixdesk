The first_turn column in sixtrack_wu needs to be None for the sixtrack job to run. --> this is confusing and inconsistent

The keys in the [fort3] section of the input.ini are only used to get the column names of the sixtrack_wu table, the values are unused. --> it could just be a list of column names...

How to control the toggling of fort blocks ?

oneturn_sixtrack_wu is empty ?
oneturn_sixtrack_results.row_num is always 1 ?
six_results.row_num is always 1 ?

consistent naming scheme of study parameters
--> no all caps vars ?
--> sixtrack style ition, icml, amp1 amp0, q1, q2, qprimex... ? 
--> python style snake case ? transition, amp_1, amp_0, tune_x, tune_y, chrom_x, ... ?
--> camel case ?
